The Model menu, has a sub menu bar with 5 menus - New - Create new models Node - Configure model structures, data connectivity and calculations Data Series - Configure data properties Settings - Configure other settings General - General properties Step1- Create new models 1.1. Create a new model from a sample model data a. Click New > Open a Sample Model > Personal Finance This dataset creates a business model to analyze and forecast savings and aims at improving the budget. Step2- Explore the model 2.1. \" Nodes \" are listed in the \" Designer mode \" at the left panel in a top-down hierarchical view. 2.2 A visual representation of the nodes is created on the Canvas at the right. Note: A Value-driver tree represents the relationship between each metrics and how they affect the overall budget. 2.3. The hierarchical model is expanded in the left panel by clicking on the \" + Expand \" button. 2.4. The \" - Collapse \" button will collapse the list to show just the parent node. Note: with metrics child-parent relationship 2.5. You can expand and collapse the nodes in the visual canvas in two ways: By clicking on the arrow next to each node By clicking on the Menu > Go to level . Choose the number of levels you want to drill down the nodes to. 2.6. The slider at the bottom of the Canvas page is used to zoom in or zoom out the node visuals. Get a bird\u2019s eye view on the business model by selecting the highest level of nodes. Zoom out to fit the view in the Canvas. 2.7. The Search box is used to search for any node by typing the node\u2019s name. As you start to type in the \u201cSearch\u201d box for a node name, a list of suggested nodes having the same search keyword is shown. Once you select the desired node, the visual graph expands up to the node that you chose. Remember selecting a node this way will not drill down any further. Nodes - properties and attributes Each Node represents a metric, and can contain the following attributes: Node Name(KPI title) Trend graph Value of metrics Performance color indicator band Each Node also contains several performance metrics: FY variance in percentage and absolute value Current month Month variance Node pop up window Click anywhere on the node \" Savings \". You will see more details about the node on the popup. Step3- Configure model structures, data connectivity 3.1. 3.2. Step4- Configure data properties 4.1. Data Series sub menu has 3 menu items - Data Series Manager : View and customize data series like duration period of data series, Period label(Jan, Feb, Mar...), and comparison data series with performance vs benchmark. Time Aggregation labels : Labels like \"Active period\", \"Till prior period\", \"All periods\", and \"Simulation period\" are used in the navigation panel, nodes and popup screens. Data Sorting : Apply custom sort of data Step5- Configure other settings 5.1. On Sub Menu bar, click on Settings 5.2. The Settings Sub menu has the following Menu Items : a. Navigation Panel - configure the settings in left panel on the \" Canvas Screen \" ----------> b. Nodes - Configure data and display format Configure the Node properties such as - \"Data mapping format\", \"Default Node Style\", and \"Node Elements\" c. Canvas - Customize items on canvas Edit the following settings - \"Default Visual - Tree or Table\", \"Tree hierarchy level\", \"Footer Toolbar\", \"Default canvas zoom(%)\", \"Default table Style\", and \"Hint text\" d. Number Formatting - Format numeric display Edit Metrics value scale suffix, display formatting and decimal separator e. Conditional Formatting - Set alert thresholds and rules Enable or disable conditional formatting based on Variance or Simulation. Also set the Formatting Thresholds(%), that are displayed as Performance color band on each Node f. Color Theme - Manage color settings Set Canvas theme as \"light\" or \"dark\" for the model simulations Set the Navigation panel theme as \"dark\" or \"light\" Or set a customized theme for your tree choosing one of the colors from the options given below. g. PopUp Screen - Configure PopUp Screen settings Set the chart type as Vertical or in the Node PopUp screen Step6- General properties - Export and share the Metrics Report 6.1. Select Model > General > Export . 6.2. The Export popup window, allow you to export the current model as a text file. Note: Move the toggle slider on the left to disable the export of Settings configurations. By default, all the navigation panel settings will be exported in the export file. 6.3.
