Model menu, has a sub menu bar with 5 menus - New - Create new models Node - Configure model structures, data connectivity and calculations Data Series - Configure data properties Settings - Configure other settings General - General properties Step1- Create new models 1.1. Create a new model from the sample model data a. Click New > Open a Sample Model > Personal Finance Note This dataset creates a business model to analyze and forecast savings and aims at improving the budget. Step2- Configure model structures and data connectivity 2.1. Click New > Model > Node 2.2. Nodes are listed in the Designer mode at the left panel in a top-down hierarchical view. 2.3 A visual representation of the nodes is created on the Canvas at the right. Note This is a Value-driver tree that represents the relationship between each metric and how it affects the overall budget. 2.3. The hierarchical model is expanded/collapsed in the left panel by using the a. Expand and b. Collapse buttons respectively Tip The + and - symbol right next to each Node gives a quick expansion and collapse feature for the nodes child-parent hierarchy. 2.4. In Canvas mode , an arrow right next to each visual Node expands and collapses the model. 2.5 Click on Go to level , and choose the number of levels you want to drill down the nodes to. 2.6. The slider at the bottom of the Canvas page is used to zoom in/out the node visuals. Tip Tip: Get a bird\u2019s eye view of the business model by selecting the highest level of nodes, and zoom out to fit the view in the Canvas. 2.7. The Search box is used to search for any node by typing the node\u2019s name. Note When you start to type in the \u201cSearch\u201d box for a node name, a list of suggested nodes having the same search keyword is shown. Once you select the desired node, the visual graph expands up to the node that you chose. Remember selecting a node this way will not drill down any further. Nodes - properties and attributes Each Node represents a metric and can contain the following attributes: Node Name (KPI title) Trend graph Value of metrics Performance color indicator band Each Metrics value represents several performance metrics: FY variance in percentage and absolute value Current monthly value in absolute value Monthly variance in percentage and absolute value Node pop up window Click anywhere on Node Savings to view more details about the node. Step3- Configure data properties 3.1. Click Model > Data Series 3.2. Data Series sub menu has 3 menu items - a. Data Series Manager View and customize data series such as: Duration period per data series (default value is 12 months/periods) Period Label (Jan, Feb, Mar..) for the month series in the navigation panel, this is a comma-separated list Comparison Data Series with Performance vs Benchmark series b. Time Aggregation labels These labels are used in the navigation panel, nodes and popup screens. The options available are: Active Period - Set the current period with its 3 letter abbreviation Till Prior Period - Set the Year Till Date month and its 3 letter abbreviation All Periods - Label series name for all the periods, and its 3 letter abbreviation Simulation Period label and its abbreviation used in the navigation panel, nodes and popup screens. c. Data Sorting This setting applies custom sort of data. Note In order to use this feature, you will need to map to the 'Value' and 'Time Period' properties of the visual.
